# Predicting Red Wine Quality using Linear Regression
This GitHub repository contains a project focused on predicting the quality of red wine using linear regression and implementing various model evaluation techniques. The project includes the following key features:

Model Evaluation Techniques:<br>
Train Test Split Procedure: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, allowing us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.<br>
Train Validation Test Split Procedure: The dataset is divided into three subsets - training, validation, and testing. The validation set helps optimize the model's hyperparameters.<br>
Cross Validation: K-fold cross-validation is employed to assess the model's generalization capability by splitting the data into multiple folds for training and evaluation.<br>
Grid Search: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search to find the best combination of parameters for the model, optimizing the predictive performance.<br>

Linear Regression Model:<br>
Linear regression is used to predict the quality of red wine based on a set of input features.
The project includes feature selection, data preprocessing, and model training steps necessary for implementing linear regression.<br>

Evaluation Metrics:<br>
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are utilized as evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
The project focuses on finding the model configuration that minimizes both MAE and RMSE, indicating the best predictive performance.
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for predicting red wine quality using linear regression and explores different model evaluation techniques to enhance the accuracy of predictions. The code, documentation, and datasets provided in this repository can be used as a reference for similar prediction tasks and serve as a valuable resource for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.
